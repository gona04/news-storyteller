## 📋 What Was Delivered

### ✨ Core Implementation

1. **Crew AI Framework** (`src/lib/crewai.ts`)
   - Agent, Task, and Crew classes
   - Sequential execution with context passing
   - Direct OpenAI GPT-4o integration
   - Verbose logging for debugging

2. **API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/crewai-narrator/route.ts`)
   - POST for generating narrations
   - GET for retrieving cached results
   - Smart file-based caching system
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Frontend Components**
   - New Crew AI page with beautiful UI
   - Automatic redirect from old Storyteller
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Smooth animations with Framer Motion

4. **Two-Agent System**
   - **Agent 1**: History Researcher (finds historical context)
   - **Agent 2**: Tolstoy Narrator (writes literary narrative)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Ensure OpenAI API Key is Set
```bash
# In .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the System
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Click any news article
- Watch as Crew AI transforms it into Tolstoy narrative
- Refresh the page and see instant cached result

## 🎯 How It Works

```
User clicks article
         ↓
Redirects to /crewai?news_link={url}
         ↓
Check cache → If cached, instant display ✨
         ↓
If not cached: Run Crew AI
         ├→ Agent 1: Research history (5-7 sec)
         ├→ Agent 2: Write Tolstoy narrative (3-4 sec)
         └→ Save to cache
         ↓
Display beautiful result with copy button
```
