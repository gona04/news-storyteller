# Migration Summary: Storyteller → Crew AI

## 🎯 Objective Completed
Successfully migrated from GPT-based text generation to a sophisticated **Crew AI system** with two specialized agents powered by **GPT-4o**.

## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### New: Crew AI Framework (`src/lib/crewai.ts`)
- **Agent Class**: Represents AI agents with role, goal, backstory
- **Task Class**: Defines work units for agents
- **Crew Class**: Orchestrates sequential agent execution
- **initializeCrew()**: Factory function to set up the two-agent system

**Features:**
- Agents can access each other's outputs (context passing)
- Sequential execution ensures logical flow
- Verbose logging for debugging
- Direct OpenAI GPT-4o integration

#### New: Crew AI API Route (`src/app/api/crewai-narrator/route.ts`)
- `POST` endpoint for generating narrations
- `GET` endpoint for retrieving cached results
- Smart caching system based on URL hash
- Error handling with detailed messages

**Cache Features:**
- File-based caching in `cache/crewai-narrator/`
- Hash-based cache keys from URLs
- Instant retrieval for repeated articles
- Transparent cache checking

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Updated: Storyteller Component (`src/components/Storyteller.tsx`)
**Old Behavior:**
- Complex multi-chunk story generation
- Audio TTS controls (now removed)
- Session-based state management

**New Behavior:**
- Simple redirect component
- Auto-detects `?url=` parameter
- Redirects to `/crewai?news_link=` (new URL scheme)
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### New: Crew AI Page (`src/app/crewai/page.tsx` + `crew-ai-client.tsx`)
**Server Component:** Handles Suspense boundary
**Client Component:** Full UI with:
- URL input form
- Processing status display
- Results with copy functionality
- Beautiful gradient design with Framer Motion
- Responsive layout (mobile + desktop)

#### Updated: NewsCard Component (`src/components/NewsCard.tsx`)
**Changed Navigation:**
- From: `router.push('/storyteller?url={url}')`
- To: `router.push('/crewai?news_link={url}')`

**Updated UI Text:**
- Old: "📖 Click to transform into literary narrative"
- New: "✨ Click to transform with Crew AI"

### 3. New Agents Configuration

#### Agent 1: History Context Agent
```javascript
role: "Expert historian who searches the internet"
goal: "Find relevant history of the news to make it understandable"
backstory: "Experienced historian with deep knowledge"
```

**Task:**
- Analyze news article
- Research historical context
- Extract relevant background
- Provide summary with history

#### Agent 2: Tolstoy Narration Agent
```javascript
role: "Leo Tolstoy, classic Russian author"
goal: "Narrate the incident as Tolstoy would"
backstory: "The legendary author known for War and Peace"
```

**Task:**
- Read article + historical context
- Write Tolstoy-style narrative
- Use simple, accessible language
- Focus on human emotions and meanings

### 4. Data Flow Changes

**Old Flow:**
```
News Link → Storyteller Page → Session-based chunks → TTS Audio
```

**New Flow:**
```
News Link → Check Cache → Crew AI (Agent 1 → Agent 2) → Cache & Display
                  ↓
         (if cached) Instant Return
```

## 🔄 Migration Path for Users

1. **User clicks news article** (unchanged experience)
2. **Frontend redirects** (automatic via NewsCard)
3. **Old URL** `/storyteller?url={url}`
   - ↓ (Storyteller component detects)
   - ✨ **New URL** `/crewai?news_link={url}`
3. **Crew AI processes**
   - Agent 1 researches history (5-10 sec)
   - Agent 2 writes Tolstoy narrative
4. **Result cached** for instant future access
